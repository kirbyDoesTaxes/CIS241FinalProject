		<h2>Reflections</h2>
		<p>From the start of this course, I've been fascinated by learning how to create a website. From the first time I got to
		make a webpage, I had this feeling of "oh so THAT'S how you do that!" Seeing how simple it was to make the initial HTML document,
		then finding out how to make numbered and bullet lists, and changing the color of the background, it felt so magical at the time.
		I still even have the same documents saved in my files.</p>
		<p>I learned how, at its core, HTML is much simpler than I thought, and far more approachable. While it can be used to make some very complex
		websites, the language itself is not as scary as I feared. Then to my delight, I learned about CSS and how much easier it makes the whole
		process. I am still thankful that it was created, because I can't imagine how much harder it would have been making this website (or any other)
		without my style sheet.</p>
		<p>While JavaScript is an incredible tool, I have not warmed up to it quite as much as with HTML and CSS. It is certainly more complex, and thus,
		a bit more daunting to use. However, after seeing what it's capable of in the lessons, I would love to learn more how I can master this tool to
		make my future websites even better.</p>
		<p>In the end, I think I've learned a great deal from this course on how to create, manage, and upkeep a website, and I'm very excited to
		continue my web development journey in the future.</p>
