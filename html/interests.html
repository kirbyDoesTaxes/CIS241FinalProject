		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>Hi there! I'm Sunny, and this is my web page! I'm happy you decided to stop by. Here, have a cookie.</p>
		<h3>Animation</h3>
		<p>I am very passionate about animation. I love how it can capture the feel of motion, or emotions that can be too hard for words, or
		actions that are impossible in a live-action medium. The works of Hayao Miyazaki, Don Bluth, James Baxter, Richard Williams are all 
		so inspiring and breath-taking to watch. Even online animators have given me so much inspiration, and so many are
		absolutely incredible animators and storytellers. Below you can see some of their work:</p>

		<p>If you love fun, dynamic cartoons, then may I have the pleasure of introducing you to the work of aimkid! She animaties with TVPaint 10, and animates
		at a framerate of only 18 frames per second (with 24 frames per second being the standard). But as you can see, the lower framerate doesn't stop her
		work from being smooth, and a delight to watch!</p>

		<h4>Zemyata</h4>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Y0_CVX1hok?si=RkAt9ATTIRhTq8dN" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
		<p>With a fluid style and a tendency to draw things that are creepy or supernatural, Zemyata's works are always interesting and stunning to watch.
		In the above music video for Eve's "Night is Faint" (Eve is also a great music artist who I reccomend checking out) you can see Zemyata's amazing 
		video that compilents the music beautifully. You can find Zemyata's channel below.</p>

		<h4>Lackadaisy</h4>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vffu6FG4YP4?si=u4m-hfJCHuSSeKol" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
		<p>This pilot for a Lackadaisy cartoon was a indie project that was a collaboration between MANY artists across the world.
		This animation is based on the webcomic by the same name (created by Tracy J. Butler) and tells a story of gangsters, buisness, and alcohol during the Prohibition era in
		St. Louis. The characters also happen to be cats!</p>


		<h3>Web Revival</h3>
		<p>The Web Revival is about reclaiming the technology that is rapidly becoming a bigger and bigger part of
		our modern lives. It's about reviving that feeling of humanity, creativity, excitment that came from surfing the Web
		in its early days. It's not exactly one single movement, but many people (including myself) have liked the idea of bringing
		back the fun and self-expression of the old web. You can learn more about it here:</p>

		<h3>Art</h3>
		<p>I love to draw, especially in cute or cartoony styles! I even drew the background, navigation buttons, cookie, and Steve sprite for this site! 
		A lot of my work is sketches on paper, and if I like it enough, I might scan it and draw over it digitally, adding color and more precise
		linework.
		I hope one day to have a proper portfolio to share my best work with everyone.</p>
		
		<h3>Horror stories</h3>
		<p>It's quite funny for someone who gets easily scared of anything and everything to be a fan of horror games and stories, but I admit that there is
		an appeal to the genre. Many of these stories that are dseigned to make you jump or sweat also deal with serious topics and tell fascinating stories.
		They can be about death, and how the main character may be dealing with grief. Silent Hill 2 (a 2001 survival horror game for the PlayStation 2) has
		a protagonist searching for his deceased wife in a mysterious town. On the other side, we have Five Nights at Freddy's with a gameplay that causes
		more fear and stress than the story. I liked playing this one because of the animatronic designs, and also because it's nice to feel scared in an
		environment that's more "safe." The works of Emily Carroll are also interestingly unnerving, with one of my favorite comics of hers being "His Face
		All Red." I'll link this below if you're interested in checking in out (but be aware that it has gore and character death. Read at your own discretion)</p>
