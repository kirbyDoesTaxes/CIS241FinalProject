      <p>Hi there! I'm Sunny, and this is my web page! I'm happy you decided to stop by. Here, have a cookie.</p>

      <p>I am a big lover of animation, 2D, 3D, hand-drawn, puppet, stop-motion,
        digital, traditional, I love them all. Whenever I could, I would watch
        "Behind the scenes" videos in the bonus features of DVDs. One of my
        favorites was the "Surfs Up" movie, a movie about surfing penguins,
        purely because I could watch them at nearly every step of the process of
        making the movie. Even though I wish to pursue the art of hand-drawn
        animation, I have little doubt that watching these professionals being
        creative, innovative, and having fun making this movie was a big
        inspiration to me.</p>
		
		<p>While I didn't exactly plan on making a career of it, I've become very 
		interested in creating websites as a personal project.
		So much of the internet has become taken over by brands and corporations, 
		and more and more of the internet is being used to try and sell goods and services.
		I missed being able to explore the web, finding websites that were personal to people,
		and websites that were created for fun and self-expression! Which is how I stumbled upon the Web Revival
		movement, which then pushed me to learn HTML and create my own website.</p>
		
      <p>I have 2 wonderful dogs, two mixed chihuahuas named Ruby and Rosa. Ruby
        is the older one, bigger and bolder, and she has two priorities in life:
        Eating as much food as possible, and playing ball. She is very
        mischievous and sneaky, taking any chance she can to steal a bite of
        someone's plate, or maybe even the whole plate! But she also loves it
        whenever we throw her a ball to chase over and over again. Rosa
        is smaller, and the most recent addition to our family. She was a rescue,
        and her previous life has made her very defensive (or "sassy" as she was called in the listing). 
		But after living with
        us for a while, she's finally been able to relax and feel like she
        doesn't have to be quite so aggressive. She's especially attached to my
        dad, and follows him around like a second shadow. Her favorite game is
        "keep away," where she tries to keep one of us from taking her toy,
        whether it be a plush sheep toy, or a scrap of tennis ball.</p>
